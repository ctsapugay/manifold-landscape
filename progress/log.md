# Progress log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. One entry per working session, plus an entry
any time a default constraint is exercised (an approval given, an assumption made, an
irreversible action taken).

This file exists so a session with no memory can resume the work. Write it for that
reader: state, not narrative.

**Entry format:**

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title

- **state:** where the project actually is right now
- **done:** what became true this session
- **next:** what the next session should pick up
- **decisions:** choices made and why, including assumptions made without asking
- **approvals:** anything Clara explicitly approved this session, quoted
- **proposals:** any proposal raised this session, and its status
- **dead ends:** what was tried and abandoned, so it is not retried
```

## 2026-08-31 — Repository created from constraint-base

- **state:** Fresh clone. No intake run yet.
- **next:** Run intake with Clara (see `CLAUDE.md`), then get the goal condition approved.
